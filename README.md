We've built interface for discrete communication with a computer, and achieved 96% accuracy on "Yes"/"No" prediciton task (n=100). The device non-invasively reads EMG sygnals around your mouth and decodes it into words.

This repo includes:
1. Sygnal processing and training code "Yes/No" task
2. Sygnal processing and training "8 commands" task
3. Detailed harware BOM and instructions
